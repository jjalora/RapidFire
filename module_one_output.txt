The rhythmic pounding of my feet against the pavement, the steady cadence of my breath, the exhilarating rush of adrenaline - running has always been my solace, my escape.

I learned that I could use my love for running as a tool for change. I organized a running club in the detention center, encouraging other inmates to join me in my daily runs. I saw the transformative power of running, as it gave us a sense of purpose, a sense of accomplishment, a sense of hope.

My time in juvenile detention was a challenge, a setback, a failure. But it was also a lesson. I learned that I am more than my mistakes, that I have the power to change, to grow, to succeed.
